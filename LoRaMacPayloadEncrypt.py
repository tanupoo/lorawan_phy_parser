'''
LoRaWAN MAC Payload encoder/decoder.

Arguments:
    buf_hex: payload in hex.
    key_hex: key in hex, len must be 32 in hex (16-byte).
    devaddr_hex: DevAddr in hex, len must be 8 in hex (4-byte).
    dir_down: UP_LINK(=0) or DOWN_LINK(=1)
    fcnt_hex: FCnt in hex, len must be 8 in hex (4-byte).
        i.e. 16-bit maintained value + 16-bit in the payload
        if you don't know the former vlaue, it should be "0000".
    bigendian:
        False if you pass the hex bytes in the LoRaWAN MAC payload as it is.
        e.g. if DevAddr is "12345678", the form in the payload is "78563412".
        if you pass "78563412" to this function, the flag of bigendian has
        to be False.

This function refers to the function, LoRaMacPayloadEncrypt().
